  Two common temperature scales are the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales.
  The boiling point of water is 212 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale and
  100 degrees on the Celsius scale. The freezing point of water is
  32 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale and 0 degrees on the Celsius scale.
  The relationship between the two temperature scales is C = 5/9 * (F - 32).

  Rankine [rang-kin] is an absolute temperature scale used by engineers.
  The Rankine degree intervals are equal to those of the Fahrenheit
  temperature scale where 0 degrees Rankine is equal to -459.67 degrees
  Fahrenheit. The two reference temperatures for Fahrenheit, the freezing
  point of water (32 degrees Fahrenheit) and the boiling point of water
  (212 degrees Fahrenheit), correspond to 491.67 degrees Rankine and
  671.67 degrees Rankine, respectively. Add 459.67 to a Fahrenheit
  temperature to get the corresponding Rankine temperature.

  Kelvin is another absolute temperature scale more commonly used for
  scientific measure. The Kelvin degree intervals are equal to those of
  the Celsius degree. The two reference temperatures for Celsius, the
  freezing point of water (0 degrees Celsius) and the boiling point of
  water (100 degrees Celsius), correspond to 273.15K and 373.15K,
  respectively. (Note: When writing temperatures in the Kelvin scale, it
  is convention to omit the degree symbol and use the letter K instead.)
  Add 273.15 to a Celsius temperature to get the corresponding Kelvin
  temperature.

  This program uses two parallel arrays, a 1-D array that holds at most
  five integer Fahrenheit temperatures & a 2-D array that holds the
  corresponding Celsius, Rankine, and Kelvin temperatures (reals).

  The Fahrenheit temperatures are read from an input file into a 1-D
  array. The corresponding Celsius temperature for each Fahrenheit
  temperature is calculated, and each Celsius temperature is stored
  in the first column of the 2-D array. The corresponding Rankine
  temperature for each Fahrenheit temperature is calculated, and each
  Rankine temperature is stored in the second column of the 2-D array.
  The Kelvin temperature corresponding to each calculated Celsius
  temperature is calculated, and each Kelvin temperature is stored in
  the third column of the 2-D array.

  A table with a title and appropriate column headers is printed to the
  output file displaing the Fahrenheit, Celsius, Rankine, and Kelvin
  temperatures, in this order.

  An appropriate message is written to the screen informing the user
  of the output file name to which the results have been written. The
  layout and content of the output are shown in the samples below.

  Note: An appropriate message is displayed to the screen if either
  the input file or the output file fails to open.

  Input:
  prog6_751inp.txt contains an unknown number of Fahrenheit temperatures,
  one per line. The input file is assumed to contain valid input values.

  Processing: (If possible, arrays are "protected" when passed to
               functions.)

  Function definitions included are described below:

  - A function printIdInfo is called to print the authors' personal information
    (names, class/section number, lab section number, due date) on the first,
    second, third and fourth lines of output. printIdInfo prints two blank lines
    after the due date. The output is directed to a file or to the screen
    depending on the call.

     e.g.  Author(s)
           C.S.1428.?       // '?' represents lecture section number
           Lab Section: L?  // '?' represents lab section number(s)
           --/--/--         // dashes represent due date, month/day/year
              <blank line>
              <blank line>

  - A function printReportHeader is called to print to the output file
    an appropriate title and column headers for a temperature conversion
    report.

    e.g.     Temperature Conversion Table

     Fahrenheit   Celsius     Rankine      Kelvin
     --------------------------------------------

  - A function readFahrenheitTemperatures is called to read five
    Fahrenheit temperatures from the input file into a 1-D array.
  - A function convertFahrenheit2Celsius is called to convert the
    Fahrenheit temperatures in the integer array to the corresponding
    Celsius temperatures, storing the Celsius temperatures in the first
    column of the 2-D array.
  - A function convertFahrenheit2Rankine is called to convert the
    Fahrenheit temperatures in the integer array to the corresponding
    Rankine temperatures, storing the Rankine temperatures in the second
    column of the 2-D array.
  - A function convertCelsius2Kelvin is called to convert the calculated
    Celsius temperatures in the 2-D array to the corresponding Kelvin
    temperatures, storing the Kelvin temperatures in the third column
    of the 2-D array.
  - A function printTemperatureConversionTable is called to print to the
    output file the Fahrenheit, Celsius, Rankine, and Kelvin temperatures
    under the appropriate column headers.
    Note: Title/Column Headers/Border Line are printed in a separate function.

     e.g.    Temperature Conversion Table

     Fahrenheit   Celsius     Rankine      Kelvin
     --------------------------------------------
         212       100.00      671.67      373.15
          32         0.00        ?.??        ?.??
               ...

  - A function printFileNotification is called to print an appropriate
    message to the screen indicating to the user the name of the output
    file to which the results have been written.

    e.g. The processed array data has been written to <filename>.
