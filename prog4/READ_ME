  This program reads the sides of a triangle in inches (real) from an input
  file, calculates the perimeter and area of the triangle and prints the
  input values plus the calculated values to an output file. An additional
  note is included when the triangle is an equilateral triangle. After all
  calculations are performed, the user is informed of the filename to which
  the output has been written.

  Input:
  The first line on the input file contains one integer value indicating
  the number of records (triangles) to process. Each subsequent line
  (record) contains three real values separated by spaces (the sides of a
  triangle). A count loop is used to process each record.

  The program processes as follows:

  - The author's personal identifying information is printed to the output
    file.
  - The number of records (triangles) to be processed is read from the
    input file.
  - As long as there are more records to process:
         - The sides of a triangle are read from the input file using only
           one statement.
         - The perimeter of the triangle is calculated.
         - If the sides of the triangle are equal,
              - The area of the equilateral triangle is calculated.
              - An appropriate message indicating that the triangle
                processed is an equilateral triangle is written to the
                output file.
           otherwise,
              - Heron's formula is used to calculate the area of a triangle.
                (It is assumed that the angles are sufficiently large as
                not to cause instability.
         - The input values plus the calculated values are written to the
           output file.
  -	The author's personal identifying information is written to the screen.
  -	An appropriate message indicating to the user the name of the output
    file to which the results have been written is displayed on the screen.

================================================================================

    Area of an equilateral triangle:
	    area = (s*s * sqrt(3)) / 4 ,
               here s represents the length of one side

    Heron's formula to calculate the area of a triangle, given three sides:
        s = perimeter / 2;
        area = sqrt(s * (s - side1) * (s - side2) * (s - side3));

    Heron's formula as given above is numerically unstable for triangles
    with a very small angle. An alternative that is considered stable
    involves arranging the lengths of the sides so that: a >= b >= c and
    uses an entirely different method to compute area. However, this
    program assumes the angles are sufficiently large so that numerical
    instability is not an issue.
