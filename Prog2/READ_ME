   This program uses one statement to read the radius of a sphere and the
   height of a cylinder (in inches) from an input file. Then it calculates 
   the surface area of the sphere and the surface area of the cylinder.

   My basic information plus the radius of the sphere and
   the height of the cylinder along with the calculated surface areas are
   written to an output file in sentence form. Numeric output values are
   displayed to two decimal places. 

   An appropriate message is displayed to the screen if there is a problem
   opening either the input file or the output file.

   Input (file - prog2_751inp.txt):
         radius in inches (same value used for sphere & cylinder), double
         height (cylinder) in inches, double

   Constants: PI = 3.141592 (double)
