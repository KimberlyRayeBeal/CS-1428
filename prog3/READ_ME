   This program displays a menu of four geometry calculator options along
   with a prompt for the user to enter his/her menu choice. (See layout
   below.)

   Geometry Calculator
        1.  Calculate the surface area of a cube.
        2.  Calculate the surface area of a sphere.
        3.  Calculate the surface area of a cylinder.
        4.  Calculate the surface area of a rectangular prism.
        5.  Quit

   Enter your choice ( 1 - 5 ):

==========================================================================
   
   If the user enters the maximum menu choice, the program will terminate
   after displaying an appropriate message on the screen.

Notes:
    - With the exception of the menu choices, all input data are real and
      measured in inches.
    - The order of operands in all standard formulas is maintained.
    - No single letter variable names are used in standard formulas.
    - 3.14159 is used for the value of PI.
    - The pow function is used for calculations involving exponentiation.
    - A named constant is used to represent the maximum menu choice to
      allow expansion of the menu options.
    - The author's identifying information is displayed on the first four
      lines of the console screen followed by two blank lines and the
      display of the geometric calculator menu.
    - Two blank lines are left before the first prompt in each case and
      again before any output message displayed on the screen.
    - All output values are appropriately labeled either by use of
      descriptive terms or by including them in complete sentence form.
    - Calculated results are displayed to two decimal places.

 Input validation is limited to the following situations:
   1) If the user enters a number outside the range of 1-MAX_CHOICE when
      selecting a menu item, an appropriate error message is displayed on
      the screen.
   2) If the user fails to enter a value greater than zero for the
      requested input values (length(s), radius, height), an appropriate
      error message is displayed on the screen.
   3) In the event that erroneous input is entered as in #1 or #2 above,
      the user is not prompted again to enter correct input. The program
      simply terminates after a message appropriate to the situation is
      displayed on the screen.
